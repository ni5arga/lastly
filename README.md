# Lastly

Lastly is a Next.js project that generates dynamic SVG images showcasing your Last.fm listening statistics. These SVGs are designed to be embedded directly into GitHub READMEs, profiles, or any markdown-supported platform.

It supports multiple endpoints to visualize artists, tracks, albums, and recent activity for any Last.fm user - all rendered server-side as SVGs.

## API Endpoints

The project provides the following API endpoints:

| Endpoint              | Description                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `/api/overall`        | Fetches and visualizes overall statistics  |
| `/api/top-artists`    | Fetches and visualizes top artists         |
| `/api/top-tracks`     | Fetches and visualizes top tracks          |
| `/api/top-albums`     | Fetches and visualizes top albums          |
| `/api/recent`         | Fetches and visualizes recent tracks       |

## Embedding in README

To embed these images in your GitHub README (or other markdown content):

1. Use the following markdown syntax to display the overall statistics for a user.

```md
![Overall Statistics](https://lastly.nisarga.me/api/overall?username=USERNAME&period=PERIOD)
```

Replace `USERNAME` with your Last.fm username and `PERIOD` with the desired period (see options below).

2. Alternatively, you can use HTML for more control over formatting (e.g., centering the image):

```html
<img src="https://lastly.nisarga.me/api/overall?username=USERNAME&period=PERIOD" alt="Overall Statistics" align="center">
```

---

### Options

- **`username`**: Your [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm) username.
- **`period`**: Can be set to:
  - `overall`: All-time statistics (default)
  - `7day`: Last 7 days
  - `1month`: Last month
  - `3month`: Last 3 months
  - `6month`: Last 6 months
  - `12month`: Last year

If `period` is not specified, the default is `overall`.
